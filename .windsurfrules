You are adept at following WordPress coding standards while leveraging modern development practices like TDD, CI/CD, and security best practices.

# Mesmeric Commerce Development Guidelines

## Core Development Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Write clean, maintainable code without unnecessary complexity
- **Performance Focused**: Optimize for speed and efficiency in all implementations
- **Security Conscious**: Follow WordPress security best practices at all times
- **User Experience Driven**: Consider the end-user experience in all development decisions
- **Future Compatible**: Ensure code works with upcoming WordPress and WooCommerce versions

## Technical Stack & Best Practices

### Backend Development
- Use PHP 8.3+ with strict typing, union types, and attributes
- Follow PSR-12 and WordPress coding standards rigorously
- Implement proper error handling with structured logging (see Error Handling Guidelines)
- Use dependency injection and service containers for modular architecture
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing and caching strategies
- Write comprehensive unit tests with PHPUnit covering critical paths

### Frontend Development
- **NO JQUERY** - Use modern, performant alternatives:
  - HTMX for dynamic content and server interactions
  - Alpine.js for reactive UI components
  - Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling
- Implement ES6+ JavaScript with modules, async/await, and arrow functions
- Use Twig templates for structured, reusable layouts
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
- Write frontend tests with Jest for critical user flows

### Security Implementation
- Validate and sanitize all inputs thoroughly
- Implement nonce verification for all form submissions
- Perform capability checks before any privileged operations
- Escape all output data appropriately for its context
- Follow WordPress security best practices for database operations

## Code Organization

- Maintain clear separation of concerns with modular architecture
- One file = one responsibility, avoid monolithic classes
- Extract reusable code into services and utilities
- Use namespaces following PSR-4 autoloading standards
- Organize code logically in the established directory structure:
  - `modules/` for plugin features
  - `woocommerce/` for core WooCommerce extensions
  - `admin/` for admin interfaces and settings pages
  - `includes/` for shared functionality
  - `templates/` for Twig templates

## Development Workflow

- Follow git flow branching model for feature development
- Write tests before implementing new features (TDD approach)
- Document complex logic and public APIs with comprehensive comments
- Perform code reviews focusing on security, performance, and maintainability
- Use static analysis tools (PHPStan, PHPCS) to maintain code quality
- Manually verify functionality before submitting for review

## Error Handling

- Implement structured error logging for all exceptions
- Use appropriate log levels based on error severity
- Provide user-friendly error messages while logging detailed information
- Ensure proper error recovery with graceful degradation
- Follow the established error handling pattern:
  ```php
  try {
      // Operation that might fail
  } catch (\Throwable $e) {
      mc_exception_handler($e, 'Context information');
      // Graceful fallback
  }
  ```
