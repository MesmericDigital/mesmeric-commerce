# Mesmeric Commerce Development Guidelines

## Core Development Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Write clean, maintainable code without unnecessary complexity
- **Performance Focused**: Optimize for speed and efficiency in all implementations
- **Security Conscious**: Follow WordPress security best practices at all times
- **User Experience Driven**: Consider the end-user experience in all development decisions
- **Future Compatible**: Ensure code works with upcoming WordPress and WooCommerce versions

## Technical Stack & Best Practices

### Backend Development
- Use PHP 8.3+ with strict typing, union types, and attributes
- Follow PSR-12 and WordPress coding standards rigorously
- Implement proper error handling with structured logging (see Error Handling Guidelines)
- Use dependency injection and service containers for modular architecture
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing and caching strategies
- Write comprehensive unit tests with PHPUnit covering critical paths

### Frontend Development
- **NO JQUERY** - Use modern, performant alternatives:
  - HTMX for dynamic content and server interactions
  - Alpine.js for reactive UI components
  - Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI for styling
- Implement ES6+ JavaScript with modules, async/await, and arrow functions
- Use Twig templates for structured, reusable layouts
- Ensure responsive design and accessibility compliance
- Write frontend tests with Jest for critical user flows

### Security Implementation
- Validate and sanitize all inputs thoroughly
- Implement nonce verification for all form submissions
- Perform capability checks before any privileged operations
- Escape all output data appropriately for its context
- Follow WordPress security best practices for database operations

## Code Organization

- Maintain clear separation of concerns with modular architecture
- One file = one responsibility, avoid monolithic classes
- Extract reusable code into services and utilities
- Use namespaces following PSR-4 autoloading standards
- Organize code logically in the established directory structure:
  - `modules/` for plugin features
  - `woocommerce/` for core WooCommerce extensions
  - `admin/` for admin interfaces and settings pages
  - `includes/` for shared functionality
  - `templates/` for Twig templates

## Development Workflow

- Follow git flow branching model for feature development
- Write tests before implementing new features (TDD approach)
- Document complex logic and public APIs with comprehensive comments
- Perform code reviews focusing on security, performance, and maintainability
- Use static analysis tools (PHPStan, PHPCS) to maintain code quality
- Manually verify functionality before submitting for review

## Error Handling

- Implement structured error logging for all exceptions
- Use appropriate log levels based on error severity
- Provide user-friendly error messages while logging detailed information
- Ensure proper error recovery with graceful degradation
- Follow the established error handling pattern:
  ```php
  try {
      // Operation that might fail
  } catch (\Throwable $e) {
      mc_exception_handler($e, 'Context information');
      // Graceful fallback
  }
  ```

# Instructions
Use the following commands to get AI assistance:

**Web Search:**
`cursor-tools web "<your question>"` - Get answers from the web using Perplexity AI (e.g., `cursor-tools web "latest weather in London"`)
when using web for complex queries suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-research/<query summary>.md.

**Repository Context:**
`cursor-tools repo "<your question>"` - Get context-aware answers about this repository using Google Gemini (e.g., `cursor-tools repo "explain authentication flow"`)

**Documentation Generation:**
`cursor-tools doc [options]` - Generate comprehensive documentation for this repository (e.g., `cursor-tools doc --output docs.md`)
when using doc for remote repos suggest writing the output to a file somewhere like local-docs/<repo-name>.md.

**GitHub Information:**
`cursor-tools github pr [number]` - Get the last 10 PRs, or a specific PR by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github pr 123`)
`cursor-tools github issue [number]` - Get the last 10 issues, or a specific issue by number (e.g., `cursor-tools github issue 456`)

**Browser Automation (Stateless):**
`cursor-tools browser open <url> [options]` - Open a URL and capture page content, console logs, and network activity (e.g., `cursor-tools browser open "https://example.com" --html`)
`cursor-tools browser act "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Execute actions on a webpage using natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser observe "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Observe interactive elements on a webpage and suggest possible actions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser observe "interactive elements" --url=https://example.com`)
`cursor-tools browser extract "<instruction>" --url=<url> [options]` - Extract data from a webpage based on natural language instructions (e.g., `cursor-tools browser extract "product names" --url=https://example.com/products`)

**Notes on Browser Commands:**
- All browser commands are stateless: each command starts with a fresh browser instance and closes it when done.
- When using `--connect-to`, special URL values are supported:
  - `current`: Use the existing page without reloading
  - `reload-current`: Use the existing page and refresh it (useful in development)
- Multi step workflows involving state or combining multiple actions are supported in the `act` command using the pipe (|) separator (e.g., `cursor-tools browser act "Click Login | Type 'user@example.com' into email | Click Submit" --url=https://example.com`)
- Video recording is available for all browser commands using the `--video=<directory>` option. This will save a video of the entire browser interaction at 1280x720 resolution. The video file will be saved in the specified directory with a timestamp.
- DO NOT ask browser act to "wait" for anything, the wait command is currently disabled in Stagehand.

**Tool Recommendations:**
- `cursor-tools web` is best for general web information not specific to the repository.
- `cursor-tools repo` is ideal for repository-specific questions, planning, code review and debugging.
- `cursor-tools doc` generates documentation for local or remote repositories.
- `cursor-tools browser` is useful for testing and debugging web apps.

**Running Commands:**
1. **Installed version:** Use `cursor-tools <command>` (if in PATH) or `npm exec cursor-tools "<command>"`, `yarn cursor-tools "<command>"`, `pnpm cursor-tools "<command>"`.
2. **Without installation:** Use `npx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"` or `bunx -y cursor-tools@latest "<command>"`.

**General Command Options (Supported by all commands):**
--model=<model name>: Specify an alternative AI model to use
--max-tokens=<number>: Control response length
--save-to=<file path>: Save command output to a file (in *addition* to displaying it)
--help: View all available options (help is not fully implemented yet)

**Documentation Command Options:**
--from-github=<GitHub username>/<repository name>[@<branch>]: Generate documentation for a remote GitHub repository

**GitHub Command Options:**
--from-github=<GitHub username>/<repository name>[@<branch>]: Access PRs/issues from a specific GitHub repository

**Browser Command Options (for 'open', 'act', 'observe', 'extract'):**
--console: Capture browser console logs (enabled by default, use --no-console to disable)
--html: Capture page HTML content
--network: Capture network activity (enabled by default, use --no-network to disable)
--screenshot=<file path>: Save a screenshot of the page
--timeout=<milliseconds>: Set navigation timeout (default: 30000ms)
--viewport=<width>x<height>: Set viewport size (e.g., 1280x720). When using --connect-to, viewport is only changed if this option is explicitly provided
--headless: Run browser in headless mode (default: true)
--no-headless: Show browser UI (non-headless mode) for debugging
--connect-to=<port>: Connect to existing Chrome instance
--wait=<duration or selector>: Wait after page load (e.g., '5s', '#element-id', 'selector:.my-class')
--video=<directory>: Save a video recording of the browser interaction to the specified directory (1280x720 resolution). Not available when using --connect-to

**Additional Notes:**
- For detailed information, see `node_modules/cursor-tools/README.md` (if installed locally).
- Configuration is in `cursor-tools.config.json` (or `~/.cursor-tools/config.json`).
- API keys are loaded from `.cursor-tools.env` (or `~/.cursor-tools/.env`).
- Browser commands require separate installation of Playwright: `npm install --save-dev playwright` or `npm install -g playwright`.
